# New York City Green Taxi Data

## Introduction

This repository is all about cleaning and analyzing New York City green taxi data. This project contains two main tasks: cleaning raw data using PySpark and building a dashboard for cleaned data using Plotly-Dash.

The data source can be downloaded from [this link](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).


## Task 1 : Cleaning

I use Jupyter Notebook and PySpark to clean up the data so I can do a quick analysis of the data and make decisions from it.

For now, I'm only using the 2020 green taxi data. This cleaning process is quite challenging because it gets confusing a lot. In the end, I had to delete a lot of rows. The notebook can be accessed [here](/NYC%20Green%20Taxi.ipynb).


## Task 2 : Building a Dashboard

The cleaned data is used to create a dashboard that will display important keys about the business. I use Plotly for plotting purpose combined with Dash to build an interactive dashboard in a web application.

The dashboard is still a work in progress but enough to show some plot there. It took me some effort to understand HTML page styles and settings. Documentation pages are a great way to learn about this amazing thing.

## Conclusion

By doing this project, there are some learning I achieved:

1. Running Spark in a notebook
2. Cleaning data by leveraging some PySpark functionalities
3. Knowledge about data format that works efficiently in Spark
4. Plotly and Dash is a good combination for making an interactive web-based dashboard.

This project is not finished yet, I will update all tasks if I find some insight.
